## Introduction
This project Uses Natural Langugage Processing techniques based on Tweets from Twitter in order to understand the usage of parks in Stockholm.
Data from Twitter were first obtained through Twitters open API. Data from three parks in Stockholm were collected between the periods 2015-2019.
The respective analysis aims to answer the following questions:
* **Temporal analysis**: How does the distribution of parks vary over time? Yearly,monthly,weekly,hourly, and seasonally.
* **Sentiment analysis**: What sentiment,positive,negative or neutral are associated with Tweets from parks.
* **Topic Modeling analysis**: What are the activities people engage in while visiting parks.

Three analysis were then performed, Temporal, Sentiment and Topic Modeling analysis. During all the steps Python was used.
