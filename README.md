The respective analysis aims to answer the following questions:
* **Temporal analysis**: How does the distribution of parks vary over time? Yearly,monthly,weekly,hourly, and seasonally.
* **Sentiment analysis**: What sentiment,positive,negative or neutral are associated with Tweets from parks.
* **Topic Modeling analysis**: What are the activities people engage in while visiting parks.

Three analysis were then performed, Temporal, Sentiment and Topic Modeling analysis. During all the steps Python was used.
